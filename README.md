## About The Project

The **Number Bond Challenge** is a collection of educational math games built with React to help young learners practice their foundational math skills. The app now includes three distinct modes‚ÄîNumber Bonds, Comparison, and Patterns‚Äîto provide a varied and engaging learning experience. It combines clear visual representations with interactive elements and a multi-level reward system to keep children motivated.

## Key Features

The application includes three distinct game modes to target different math skills:

* **üî¢ Number Bonds:** A clear, visual representation of the "part-part-whole" math concept, complete with related addition and subtraction sentences.

* **‚öñÔ∏è Comparison (< > =):** Students compare two numbers, each shown with a corresponding set of countable cubes, and select whether the first is greater than, less than, or equal to the second.

* **‚û°Ô∏è Patterns:** A skip-counting game where students must identify the next number in a sequence (counting by 1s, 2s, 5s, or 10s) from multiple-choice options.

### Core Mechanics
* **Visual Counting Aids:** Interactive, clickable cubes help children visualize the numbers in each problem.
* **Rewarding Progression:** A "Star Power" progress bar fills with each correct answer, awarding a glowing, sparkling star upon completion.
* **Leveling System:** After earning 5 stars, the player "levels up" to a new set of colored stars, providing long-term goals.
* **Engaging Feedback:** Fun animations, like popping answers and confetti bursts, celebrate success.
* **Adjustable Difficulty:** The maximum number used in problems can be easily changed to match the child's skill level.

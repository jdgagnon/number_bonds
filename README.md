## About The Project

The **Number Bond Challenge** is an educational web application built with React to help young learners practice their foundational math skills. The game provides a multi-sensory learning experience, combining visual number bonds, interactive counting cubes, and positive reinforcement through animations and a star-based reward system. The difficulty is adjustable, making it suitable for children at various learning stages.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Number Bonds:** A clear, visual representation of the "part-part-whole" math concept.
* **Counting Cubes:** Clickable, color-coded cubes to help children visualize the problem and count the numbers.
* **Multiple Problem Types:** Automatically generates related addition and subtraction sentences to reinforce learning.
* **Rewarding Progression:**
    * A "Star Power" progress bar fills with each correct answer.
    * Filling the bar awards a glowing, sparkling star.
    * After earning 5 stars, the player "levels up" to a new set of colored stars.
* **Engaging Feedback:** Fun animations, like popping answers and confetti bursts, celebrate correct answers and goal completion.
* **Adjustable Difficulty:** The maximum total for problems can be easily changed to match the child's skill level.
